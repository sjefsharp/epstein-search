    # IMPORTANT: CodeQL requires GitHub Advanced Security and Code Scanning to be enabled.

    # For private repos, this requires a GitHub Enterprise subscription.
    # For public repos, Advanced Security is free but must be manually enabled.
    # If not enabled, this workflow will fail with "Code scanning is not enabled for this repository".
